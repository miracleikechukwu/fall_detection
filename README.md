# Fall Detection from Video Footage

This document demonstrates how to detect falls from video footage. The dataset used for training and testing our model is found in the link https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/7w7fccy7ky/4
The training and testing were done done using videos from the dataset above. 70 videos from the dataset were used for training.

## Running the Code

The implementation was done on Google Colab and can be replicated by running each cell block sequentially. Visualisation of detection output was done using Streamlit.

In order to render detection output in Streamlit, run the section regarding Streamlit visualisation. Upon running it, Streamlit generates a proxy site with a link and the can be accessed using the IP address also generated when the it is initialised.

NB: The generated site link and IP address changes upon restart of runtime environment.
